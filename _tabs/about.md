Hello there! I’m Suraj, a passionate cybersecurity student and an aspiring Red Teamer. I have a strong curiosity and an unstoppable urge to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity, especially when it comes to understanding how things work.

I love exploring, learning, and teaching. Whether it’s uncovering system vulnerabilities, experimenting with new tools, or mastering complex concepts, I’m always eager to go deeper and learn something new every day.
