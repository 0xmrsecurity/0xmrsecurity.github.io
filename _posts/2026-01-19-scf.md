# Force NTLM Authentication with Windows
- To force NTLM authentication in Windows, configure the "Network Security: LAN Manager authentication level" policy to enforce NTLMv2 usage. 
- NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) is a suite of Microsoft security protocols used to authenticate users, provide data integrity, and ensure confidentiality in Windows networks.
- It is a challenge-response authentication protocol, meaning it verifies user identity without transmitting the password over the network.
