# NetExec RDP
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary network protocol developed by Microsoft that enables users to connect to and control another computer or device over a network connection.
- It provides a graphical interface for remote access, allowing users to interact with the remote system as if they were physically present
- RDP allows connections to the service only to hosts with Network level authentication (NLA).
- RDP operates on a client-server model, where the client (local device) connects to the host (remote computer) via port 3389 by default, establishing a secure, encrypted communication channel
