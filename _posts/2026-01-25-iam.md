# ⛈️ IAM
IAM Stands for Identity and Access Management (IAM).It is a framework used in cloud computing to control and Manage.
- Who can access: This includes users, applications, and services that require entry to the system.
- What can be accessed: This pertains to resources, data, and applications that are available to authorized entities.
- Under what conditions: This involves defining permissions, policies, and authentication methods to regulate access.

`IAM ensures secure and controlled access to cloud resources.`
```bash 
# Put all details like Access key, Secret keys, Region and Formate.
aws configure --profile <Profile Name> 

# whoami command
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile <Profile Name>
```

## Users
Users represent people or applications. They have long-term credentials like usernames, passwords, and access keys.
- Types:
     - End Users: Typical users who access applications and services.
     - Service Accounts: Non-human accounts used by applications or services to interact with other services.

```bash
# Get User Detail
aws iam get-user --profile <Profile Name>

# list Users in IAM
aws iam list-users --profile <Profile Name>

# List Access Keys (single user have two access keys, if 1 is there so u can create a second one as a backdoor)
aws iam list-access-keys --profile <Profile Name>
```     
     
##  Groups
Groups are just a way to manage permissions for multiple users at once.    
- Example
If I have five backend engineers at Hackers University who all need the same access, it’s a lot easier to stick them in a group and apply one policy to the group rather than duplicating it across five users.

```bash
# check in which Group are in
aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name <User Name> --profile <Profile Name>

# List all Available Groups
aws iam list-groups --profile <Profile Name>

# List all Users in Groups
aws iam get-group --group-name <Group Name> --profile <Profile Name>

# list Group Policies
aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <Group Name> --profile <Profile Name>  

# Detail about Specific Group Policies
aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <Group Name> --policy-name <Policy Name> --profile <Profile Name>

```

##  Policies
-  Rules that define permissions for users and groups regarding access to resources.
-  Policies define what a user, group, or role can and can’t do. They’re written in JSON and attached to IAM entities. 
There are two kinds:-
1. Managed Policies – Reusable across users and groups. These are easier to manage and scale.
2. Inline Policies – Attached directly to one user or group. These are harder to track and often the source of privilege escalation bugs in real-world environments.
`In pentests, most of the misconfigurations, come down to sloppy or forgotten policies—especially inline ones.`

```bash
# list Attached Policies
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <User Name>--profile <Profile Name>

# Get More Detail about Specific Policies
aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <User Name> policy-name <Policy Name> --profile <Profile Name>
```

## Roles
Roles are like users but without long-term credentials. You assume a role temporarily, and AWS gives you credentials that expire after a set time. 
- Example:-
    - if I’m a security analyst investigating an incident, I might assume a role that gives me access to logs for a few hours and then loses access when I’m done. Roles help enforce the principle of least privilege.
 
```bash
# list Roles
aws iam list-roles --profile <Profile Name>

# Query to Specific Role Names
aws iam list-roles --query "Roles[?RoleName=='Role Name']" --profile <Profile Name>

# List Role Policies
aws iam list-role-policies  --role-name <Role Name> --profile <Profile Name>

# Get Detail About Policies
aws iam get-role-policy  --role-name <Role Name> --policy-name <Policy Name> --profile <Profile Name>
```

## Final check list (what to watch for) 
- Users with excessive permissions.
- Roles that can be assumed.
- Policies that use wildcards (e.g., "Action": "*" or "Resource": "*").
- Services or Lambda functions with elevated permissions that you can potentially abuse.


# Cheatsheet
```bash
# IAM Enumeration CLI commands
## Retrieves general account information about including IAM users, groups, 
## roles, and policies, and their relationships to one another. 
## These are meant to be non-destructive enumeration commands. They only retrieve information. They do not modify resources.
## Official AWS IAM CLI documentation: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/iam/index.html

# The "whoami" in AWS
aws sts get-caller-identity # Returns details about the IAM user or role whose credentials are used to call the operation. While not an IAM command (it's an STS command), this is often the first command that gets used for IAM enumeration which is why it's included here. 
# No policy can deny issuing this command since it gives the same information when access is denied. More on that here: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html

# General IAM account information
aws iam get-account-authorization-details # Gives a snapshot of the configuration of IAM permissions (users, groups, roles, and  policies) and their relationships in your account.

# User enumeration
aws iam list-users
aws iam list-service-specific-credentials # Get service-specific credentials associated with the IAM user
aws iam get-user --user-name <username> # Get metadata of user. Includes permissions boundaries!
aws iam list-access-keys [--user-name <value>] # List existing access keys for a specific user (your current user being the default if no value is specified)
aws iam list-user-policies --user-name <username> # Get inline policies for a user
aws iam get-user-policy --user-name <username> --policy-name <policyname> # Get details about an inline policy
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name <username> # Get attached (managed) policies (instead of inline policies). These can be either AWS-managed or Customer-managed policies
aws iam get-login-profile --user-name # Checks to see if the user has a login profile (password to log into the AWS Console). Returns the UserName and CreatedDate, which reflects the creation date of the password

# Groups Enumeration 
aws iam list-groups # Get groups in account
aws iam list-groups-for-user --user-name <username> # Get groups related to a user
aws iam get-group --group-name <name> # Get a group's details
aws iam list-group-policies --group-name <username> # Get inline policies of a group
aws iam get-group-policy --group-name <username> --policy-name <policyname> # Get inline policy details
aws iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name <name> # Get attached (managed) policies for a group (instead of inline policies). These can be either AWS-managed or Customer-managed policies

# Enumerate roles
aws iam list-roles # Get roles in the AWS account
aws iam get-role --role-name <role-name> # Get details about a specific role
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <name> # Get inline policies of a role
aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <name> --policy-name <name> # Get inline policy details
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <role-name> # Get attached (managed) policies for a role (instead of inline policies). These can be either AWS-managed or Customer-managed policies

# Enumerate policies
aws iam list-policies [--only-attached] [--scope Local] # List policies
# [--only-attached] is optional and will list policies only if they're attached to an IAM user/group/role
# [--scope local] is optional and will only list policies that are Customer-managed, not AWS-managed. --scope AWS would be the opposite
aws iam list-policies-granting-service-access --arn <identity> --service-namespaces <svc> # Get list of policies that a user/group/role can use to access a specific service
# Example: aws iam list-policies-granting-service-access --arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/UserName --service-namespaces eks
aws iam get-policy --policy-arn <policy_arn> # Get details for a specific policy
aws iam list-policy-versions --policy-arn <arn> # Returns information about policy versions for a specific managed policy, including which one is the current default version
aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn <arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/example-policy> --version-id <v1 or v2 or ...> # Get details for a specific policy version since policies can have multiple versions
aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <value> # Lists all the IAM users/groups/roles that the managed policy is attached to

# MFA
aws iam list-mfa-devices [--user-name <username>]  # Get list of all MFA devices for a specific user. If no user is provided, AWS auto determines the user based on the access key ID
aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices [--assignment-status <value>] # Get list of all MFA devices in the AWS account
# Can use optional --assignment-status to filter by Assigned, Unassigned, or Any (the default)
```
