# SYSCO Lab Walkthrough

### Scenario
Sysco is a Managed Service Provider that has tasked you to perform an external penetration testing on their active directory domain. You must obtain initial foothold, move laterally and escalate privileges while evading Antivirus detection to obtain administrator privileges.

### Objectives and Scope
The core objective of this external penetration test is to simulate a realistic, determined adversary to achieve Domain Administrator privileges within Sysco's Active Directory (AD) environment. Starting from an external position, we will focus on obtaining an initial foothold, performing lateral movement, and executing privilege escalation while successfully evading Antivirus (AV) and other security controls. This is a red-team exercise to find security weaknesses before a real attacker does.
